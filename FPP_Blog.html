                        <p style ="text-align:justify"><b>M</b>uch debate, research and experimentation has been devoted to the theory of nature versus nurture with regards child behavioral outcome. No doubt genetic predisposition have a part to play in the shaping of the character outcome of a child, nonetheless much emphasis on this factor can be misleading, resulting in parental-inactiveness, “Many are also strongly tempted to attribute even complex behaviors to inborn traits, saying,</p><p> “He was just born that way.” In overemphasizing genetic influence, parents may feel less pressure to intervene when their children veer off into less desirable habits.”(Alan, Dolahite& Draper, 2006,p.119)</p>

The home is the basis of a righteous life, and no other instru-mentality can take its place or fulfill its essential functions in carrying forward this God-given responsibility (First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1999, p. 3). </p>

                        <p style ="text-align:justify">No doubt how a child is nurtured especially during their formative years is a huge determinant how they emerge as adults. Presence of parental supervision or the lack thereof can easily be seen in single versus both parent homes. Children who grow up often without father figures sometimes tend to lack a wholeness of security. May turn out unruly or have challenges on how to act towards authority figures.</p>
                        <p style ="text-align:justify">There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

                        <p style ="text-align:justify">As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>
